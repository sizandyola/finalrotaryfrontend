            class="text-justify"
          >The first few days after the April 25th earthquake there was so much uncertainty, different reports were coming in from the field and phone communication was intermittent. The one constant was that everyone who was asking for help was asking for some kind of shelter or cover from the elements for people who had lost their homes. Tents, tarpaulins, and corrugated iron sheets were in very short supply but we worked quickly to secure more than 1300 tarpaulins: including 400 donated by UNHCR; and about 375 donated by our own Rotary International District 3292.</p>
          <p
            class="text-justify"
          >In the three weeks following the earthquake, we distributed tents and tarpaulins to affected districts as follows: Sindhupalchowk: 450; Gorkha: 350; Kavre: 170; Nuwakot: 94; Makwanpur: 50; Kathmandu: 75; and Dhading: 100. Most of these items, together with 150 solar lamps (donated by UNHCR), were delivered by truck, while some transport was donated, in most cases RC KTM Mid-Town paid for the transport. In one case, where the roads were blocked and we heard the situation was dire, we delivered some 150 tents to the most affected areas in Sindupalchowk by helicopter.

            This project is in collaboration with our friends at the Rotary Club of Singapore. The Earthquake Fund has helped to develop opportunities for improved livelihood and food security of communities in Nuwakot District. These earthquake affected communities are learning: organic vegetable production; seed preservation; and enterprise development. Women’s groups are learning now to grow organic vegetables and will develop the entrepreneurial and technical skills to successfully grow, harvest, process, and market coffee in Kathmandu and regionally.
            This success story was also covered in the Nepali weekly, Nepali Times, article, “Four years later, Nepal’s farmers rise from the rubble One day Kathmandu’s cappuccinos will be made with beans grown by Nuwakot’s earthquake-hit farmers”.

The new building was designed and built in a robust earthquake resistant manner with strong foundations.</p>

            One of the classrooms in the newly built school, now serves as e-library as part of an earlier project supported by RC Kathmandu Mid-Town in partnership with OLE Nepal. In 2016-17 a small but safe and hygienic toilet block was also constructed in the school premises with earlier support from RC Kathmandu Mid-Town.
            As a result of all this, nearly 450 students (250 girls and 200 boys) and about 20 teachers and staff are now able to use the reconstructed premises to ensure basic education in this remote, needy community.

          <h4>Bungamati School</h4>

          <p class="text-justify">
            Tri-Ratna Cooperative School, Bungamati – was established in 1992; it educates 232 children from the disadvantaged communities of Bungamati and neighboring villages (Chunikhel, Farsidole, Dukuchhap, Chhampi, Sainbu). It was very badly hit during the 2015 earthquake.
            <br />This project is in collaboration with our Rotary District 3292’s ERRRP (Earthquake Relief, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Program) and the Rotary Club of Nanaimo Daybreak, Canada.
