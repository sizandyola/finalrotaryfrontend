                  Background: Brick making is a seasonal industry which operates during the winter months soon after the monsoon and harvesting season. The professional workers are hired prior to the season from villages far and wide and live in the temporary shelter made of unbaked bricks in the kiln area for over seven months. Since both the parents are employed the children accompany them without any thought of their immediate and future education. It is but reasonable that schools do not grant such a long leave hence often parent have to choose between earning and education and obviously the first is chosen it being their profession for sustenance of their family. Since parents have taken their children out of school against the school regime at the risk of termination from school readmission after six months absentee is not guaranteed. </p>

            <p>
Besides how would the children be able to cope with the studies when during this period they would be playing ( the very young ones ) the older ones are helping their parents in the same trade of brick making . Thus the NGO KOPILA NEPA with six satellite centers provides humanitarian service for these disadvantaged mobile children who are dropouts because of necessity. So far governmental support has not be granted as according to their ruling an Institute has to be functional for the whole year to be eligible for support. However we are looking for loop holes in the system to help in sustaining such program. The main center KOPILA Nepa at Sanu Gaon provides the following: <br>

Preprimary and primary classes which is operational for some local children the and those of the brick factory workers who remain back to maintain the kiln throughout the year. On completion they are helped to getting admission into regular government school (with which this Institute has an understanding ) by even paying the initial admission fee and uniform for them. <br>

Adult literacy and skill sewing class for the female gender local and brick workers. Is also being operated. This a government recognized training program for one year with awarding of valid certificate. Many women seek for further three months advanced course or they venture out to open small outlet or seek employment in the same profession. Classes for the older children of brick factory workers during the season <br>

Provision of nutritious Mid- Day meal <br>
Sustaining the transport system for the center <br>
Provision of uniform plus educational material for the six month academic session <br>
Running of Day Care Center for children with Cerebral Palsy and in co-operation of these children in the program and activities of the normal children <br>

                  Rotary Club Kathmandu Midtown along with the spouses’ team, is
                  eager to make a difference through this latest project of
                  Matatirtha Old Age Home. It is a community supported, grass
                  roots level initiative, that has been operating for over
                  twenty years. The management team has rescued abandoned elder
                  women from the streets of Nepal and provided them long-term
                  safe home along with food and shelter. They operate on a very
                  meagre budget. We hope to make a difference by helping them
                  become more sustainable and by bringing some positive and
                  much-needed change. <br />
                  This year, our Club members in collaboration with spouses,
                  have supported the Matatirtha Old Age Home based on their
                  needs and request in certain critical areas. Several members
                  have contributed in cash and kind. With the funds raised we
                  have placed a help who now looks after the Aamas. Eleven
                  housekeeping students from Silver Mountain School of Hotel
                  Management, organized an event to clean the home and also
                  teach the caretaker how to properly utilize the cleaning
                  material. <br />
                  Daya Foundation, a non profit organization offered to provide
                  a free heath camp for these seniors in coordination with
                  Chhatrapati Free Clinic (CFC). A team of 12 medical personnel
                  from CFC conducted ENT and whole-body checkup for all the
                  Aamas and the community people. One member from RCKMT provided
                  curtains and yet another has generously offered to help with
                  the construction of much-needed toilets. We look forward to
                  seeing these elderly ladies enjoy certain comfort and care and
                  live with some dignity, good health and convenience.

                  Chitrapur Day Care Center for Cerebral Palsy Children through

                  center houses some children with residential care and provides
                  them with the physiotherapy that they need as well, offers
                  services for the neighboring community as well as more distant
                  areas through its outreach program. At its headquarters in
                  Dhapakhel, the SGCP welcomes parents and affected children
                  from remote areas and gives them much-needed awareness
                  training and counseling. The practical advice that they
                  receive helps them to deal with day-to-day situations back in
                  their villages so that children can grow up in their own
                  communities. The Chitrapur center provides much-needed day
