              This is an interesting new initiative that aims to provide career guidance, training, and connection opportunities to young people in Nepal who face challenges in accessing education and lack support and guidance in order to pursue their chosen career goals. 
The Career Connection Program is an innovative and important initiative that has the potential to make a real difference in the lives of young people in Nepal. The program leverages the strengths and expertise of both EduLift and Rotary to provide the assistance that youth in the Kathmandu Valley will need to become fully functioning and contributing members of society.

            </h5>
            <p>
              Snakebite is one of the most neglected public health issues in rural Nepal.  Estimates show that every year at least 40,000 people are bitten (due to lack of awareness) and some 3000 die (from inadequate medical care). Not only do rural communities lack awareness on how to prevent and treat snakebite, but they also lack a political voice as evinced by the fact that snakebite has been severely neglected by both international and national policy-makers and donors, the pharmaceutical industry, the media, and academia. To date, there has not been any concerted, coordinated effort to eradicate this problem in Nepal.

          The recently awarded GG2099153 will help to reduce mortality and morbidity caused by snakebite in Nepal by promoting prevention through public awareness. It will inform that portion of the population who is most at risk to the dangers of snakebite by sharing information on awareness, prevention, and first-aid through a four-year, country-wide, multi-media campaign. In addition, since each public service announcement will carry the Rotary logo, this country-wide campaign will enhance Rotary’s public image as an organization dedicated to serving the country. This Global Grant will roll out in early 2021 and will deploy a coordinated ‘media package’ (in five local languages) that targets Nepal’s most vulnerable through radio, social media, app, posters, street theatre, web page and the like.
We are happy to acknowledge our partners: The Rotary Club of Salt Lake City, RID 5420 USA, RID 3722 & RID 3510 S. Korea, RC Higashiosaka-Nishi Japan, and the BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences, Dharan, NEPAL.

              Early years Education Support Project, Sindhupalchok, Nepal, (Global Grant 1979704) in collaboration with RC Ellon, District 1010, Scotland. Schools in Sindhupalchok and Nuwakot areas of rural Nepal will be supported to improve learning in 13 classrooms in selected schools. The program will support schools that have shown willingness to change and are most in need. The grant will support upgrading the standard of the schools in terms of physical environment, teaching and the quality of education. Teachers will be given support and training to adopt modern child friendly learning methods and to take ownership and responsibility for the school environment.
              The project is implemented through our partners at First Steps Himalaya. First Steps Himalaya—Giving children a childhood in the rural Himalaya.

                (Update) On Sunday 3 March 2024 nine Midtowners including  President, VP and Treasurer and two Rotaracts enjoyed a great day in Sindupalchok visiting our First Steps Early Years Education Global Grant project, hosted by CEO Durga Aran and his staff. Braving wet weather and poor roads, the team visited the four kindergarten classes of Shree Kalikadevi school at Sangachok. We then drove to the training centre and primary school at Jana Jyoti, both constructed by First Steps Nepal. After 11 years successful collaboration and three consecutive GGs, this was a memorable final  monitoring visit. We travelled in Rupy’s International Schools yellow buses and enjoyed a splendid lunch at the Early Years Education teacher training Centre.

              This year with the help of the Rotary Club of Potomac-Bethesda, RID 7620, USA, we helped to preventing hearing loss among Nepalese children by providing auditory screening and surgical equipment, by screening children for correctible ear problems, by providing ear surgery for children and by promoting increased awareness and prevention.
